# 🫁 Post-COVID Lung Disease Detection using Deep Learning 🧠📸

## 📖 About the Project

International healthcare systems are facing unprecedented challenges due to the **COVID-19 pandemic**, especially in managing its **long-term respiratory effects**. Survivors often develop complications such as:

- 🫁 **Lung Fibrosis**
- 🤒 **Pneumonia**
- 🎗️ **Lung Cancer**

These complications require **early and accurate detection** to ensure timely treatment. However, **resource constraints**, a **shortage of radiologists**, and the **subjective nature** of manual X-ray interpretation result in diagnostic delays and errors.

### 💡 Our Solution

This project introduces a **deep learning-based diagnostic system** powered by the 🧠 **Xception model**, a high-performance **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** designed for medical image analysis. Key benefits include:

- ✅ **High Accuracy** in classifying COVID-related lung conditions  
- ⚡ **Fast and Scalable** solution for high/low-resource environments  
- 🌍 **Telemedicine Ready** — remote diagnosis through chest X-rays  
- 🤖 **Reduces Radiologist Workload** with AI-assisted support
